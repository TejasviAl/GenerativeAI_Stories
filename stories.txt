Once upon a time there was a poor woodcutter who lived with his two children, Hansel and Gretel. The family was very poor and had very little food. One night, the stepmother convinced the father to abandon the children in the forest. Hansel, however, had overheard the plan and filled his pockets with white pebbles. As they were led into the woods, Hansel dropped the stones to mark the way back. When the parents left them, the children followed the trail and returned home safely. The stepmother was angry, and the next day she tried again. This time Hansel used breadcrumbs, but the birds ate them, and the children were lost. After wandering for days, they found a gingerbread house. An old witch lived there, and she captured Hansel to fatten him up. Gretel tricked the witch into the oven and freed her brother. The children found treasures in the house and went home to their father, who welcomed them with tears of joy.
